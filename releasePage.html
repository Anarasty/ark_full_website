        <br><br>
        <p>As we stand on the horizon between the ending of an era and the dawn of the next, we'll take a moment to reflect on the extraordinary journey we've shared. Your exuberance, sense of community, and the vivid tapestry of experiences you've woven in the world of ARK: Survival Evolved have truly brought our creation to life. You’re the beating heart of our “little” dinosaur game.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Some might consider the upcoming transition a bittersweet occasion punctuated by a sense of loss and sadness. We feel otherwise. Unofficial ASE is in great hands. Yours.</p>
        <br>
        <p>But, as one chapter concludes, another unfolds – and again our stories will mix with yours to create something greater than the sum of two parts. Remember, it's not farewell, it’s “see you real soon” with more ASA news, reveals, gameplay and, ultimately, the launch of ARK: Survival Ascended near the end of October! So, Survivors, thank you for eight incredible years and here’s to many more.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Introducing everyone's favourite submarine saurian, Shastasaurus!</h3>
        <br>
        <img src="https://clan.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/images//8729288/9c633e5613d43d28ca422185d4b68fc55583c727.jpg" alt="dino_modal_img">
        <br>
        <h3>Wild</h3>
        <p>This odd variant of Shastasaurus seems as curious about humans as its distant relative Ichthyosaur. It sure got my attention when one of these sea monsters swam up to have a look at me! Luckily, its bulk turns out to be worse than its bite.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Shastasaurus has weaponized the ultrasonic chirps it uses for echolocation. It can focus those sounds into a tight cone that disorients prey, or widen the effect to blast apart a school of fish in a concussive wave.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Domesticated</h3>
        <p>Taming a Shastasaurus was one of the most rewarding experiences of my life. I brought  along some Ichthyosaur pals to entertain their larger cousin while I scraped some of its itchy barnacles off with a sickle. From then on, I had a gigantic escort in deep water.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Some tribes manage to kit out their finny friend with a periscope, torpedo bays, and even a cargo hold… Those Shastasaurs end up looking like something from the old kids’ cartoon with cavemen who turned dinos into cars and submarines!</p>

      <br><br>
      <p>Our next Community Creature Vote winner will land on the corrupted earth, Extinction. Prepare your submissions for what we expect will bring out the endless creativity of our amazing community and you may find your creature making its debut with the release of the Extinction map on ARK: Survival Ascended!</p>
      <br>
      <p>Please note that this creature will be released for Extinction, so make sure your real-world submissions are in theme with that map! As previously stated, we’ll add an additional real-world creature for each expansion pack map release on ARK: Survival Ascended.</p>

      <h1>Community Crunch 375: Introducing Yi Ling and more!</h1>
      <h3>Introducing everyone's favourite feather-firing fiend, the fierce Yi Ling</h3>
      <br>
      <img src="https://clan.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/images//8729288/998e269529ddef5550a3793aa277b6cc0b5a1f67.jpg" alt="dino_modal_img">
      <br><br>
      <p>Species: Yi Ling. Time: Late Jurassic. Diet: Omnivore. Temperament: Aloof</p>
      <br>
      <h3>Wild</h3>
      <br>
      <p>This feathered fella is so much bigger than the Yi species I knew in my day! Despite its aberrant size, Yi ling is still somehow light enough to cling to walls and it can even glide short distances. It’s light on its feet as well, able to dodge attacks on the run.</p>
      <br>
      <p>I’m glad Yi seems to prefer prey smaller than itself, because it can eject a spray of barbed feathers at an unhappy target before darting in to rip them back out. Its unique firepower may expose Yi in the short term, but its protective plumage regrows fast.</p>
      <br>
      <h3>Domesticated</h3>
      <br>
      <p>A tamed Yi makes for an excellent -- if precarious -- hunting mount. Some tribes use them as caravan scouts, others to torment enemy forces.</p>
      <br>
      <p>I’ve seen Yi scarf up the weird mushrooms, congealed gas balls, and nameless creatures scurrying around down here. Who knows what effect a diet like that would have on its feathery weaponry? Watch what your Yi eats, and you just might learn to sharpen its fighting skills!</p>
      <br>
      <h3>ASA X Nitrado partnership</h3>
      <br>
      <p>Snail Games USA and Studio Wildcard have officially teamed up with Nitrado to be the exclusive commercial server host for ARK: Survival Ascended. Partnering with Nitrado allows for:</p>
      <br>
      <p>ARK: Survival Ascended will support Overwolf integration into Nitrado’s services, which makes it easier to manage mods directly from a web interface. You will be able to browse an expansive library of mods and easily manage them with a click of a button, no more messing around with .ini files! Critically, ASA’s direct server integration with Nitrado’s infrastructure enables the cross-platform online mod functionality between PC and consoles.</p>
      <br>
      <p>We’ll also be working closely with Nitrado on their SteelShield protection services which defends against DDoS attacks, so we can ensure uninterrupted gaming on our ASA servers.</p>
      <br>
      <p>We understand that some people would prefer to manage their own servers, and so this partnership does not prevent you from hosting or managing your own non-commercial ASA servers with your own hardware. Together with Nitrado’s seamless integration of ASA’s revolutionary cross-platform mod system, we're committed to bringing players the next evolution in ARK's journey!</p>

    <h1>Community Crunch 371: Introducing Gigantoraptor and more!</h1>
    <h3>Introducing everyone's favourite nimble nurturer, the noble Gigantoraptor</h3>
    <br>
    <img src="https://clan.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/images//8729288/fe495d02d8d1d440a23159e905d268055c43c045.jpg" alt="dino_modal_img">
    <br><br>
    <p>Species: Gigantoraptor nutritor. Time: Late Cretaceous. Diet: Omnivore. Temperament: Territorial</p>
    <br>
    <h3>Wild</h3>
    <br>
    <p>Unless you’re planning to raid its nest, you shouldn’t let this creature’s imposing size worry you. Gigantoraptor may be fiercely protective of its brood, but it’s much more of a caregiver than a fighter.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Don’t get me wrong -- this theropod will use its sharp claws and surprising speed to defend its young when threatened. But Gigantoraptor has a soft heart for young ones -- it’ll even take in the orphaned babies of rival species.</p>
    <br>
    <h3>Domesticated</h3>
    <br>
    <p>Now for the bad news: to my knowledge, no one’s been able to figure out how to tame an adult Gigantoraptor – its unique disposition seems resistant to behavioral conditioning. However, Survivors bolder than me were able to sneak into nests to win the trust of their young, and they claim that reward is well worth the risk.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Once matured to adulthood, your tamed Gigantoraptor will happily look after any of your tribe’s young creatures, nurturing them and teaching them how to fight. It can even use its call to help you find orphaned baby animals out in the wild. If you bring those orphans home, then your Gigantoraptor will happily add them to its brood.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Gigantoraptor forms an inseparable bond with its young charges. Bring them into a fight together and they will defend each other, and your tribe, far more effectively than when apart.</p>
    <br>
    <h3>Community creature vote</h3>

    <br><br>
    <p>The competition is reaching its boiling point as we near the end of the Community Creature Vote. Soon, we'll know which entry will emerge victorious! You still have the weekend to vote for which creature will be added to Aberration for ARK: Survival Ascended! </p>
    <br>
    <p>The second round of voting ends on July 24th at 4 PM Pacific.</p>
