        <h3>Welcome to another edition of the community crunch!</h3>
        <br>
        <iframe width="900" height="450" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/egBXYM9N_R0" title="ARK - We Aren&#39;t Meant to Live Forever" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
        <br><br>
        <p>As we stand on the horizon between the ending of an era and the dawn of the next, we'll take a moment to reflect on the extraordinary journey we've shared. Your exuberance, sense of community, and the vivid tapestry of experiences you've woven in the world of ARK: Survival Evolved have truly brought our creation to life. You’re the beating heart of our “little” dinosaur game.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Some might consider the upcoming transition a bittersweet occasion punctuated by a sense of loss and sadness. We feel otherwise. Unofficial ASE is in great hands. Yours.</p>
        <br>
        <p>But, as one chapter concludes, another unfolds – and again our stories will mix with yours to create something greater than the sum of two parts. Remember, it's not farewell, it’s “see you real soon” with more ASA news, reveals, gameplay and, ultimately, the launch of ARK: Survival Ascended near the end of October! So, Survivors, thank you for eight incredible years and here’s to many more.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Introducing everyone's favourite submarine saurian, Shastasaurus!</h3>
        <br>
        <img src="https://clan.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/images//8729288/9c633e5613d43d28ca422185d4b68fc55583c727.jpg" alt="dino_modal_img">
        <br>
        <h3>Wild</h3>
        <p>This odd variant of Shastasaurus seems as curious about humans as its distant relative Ichthyosaur. It sure got my attention when one of these sea monsters swam up to have a look at me! Luckily, its bulk turns out to be worse than its bite.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Shastasaurus has weaponized the ultrasonic chirps it uses for echolocation. It can focus those sounds into a tight cone that disorients prey, or widen the effect to blast apart a school of fish in a concussive wave.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Domesticated</h3>
        <p>Taming a Shastasaurus was one of the most rewarding experiences of my life. I brought  along some Ichthyosaur pals to entertain their larger cousin while I scraped some of its itchy barnacles off with a sickle. From then on, I had a gigantic escort in deep water.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Some tribes manage to kit out their finny friend with a periscope, torpedo bays, and even a cargo hold… Those Shastasaurs end up looking like something from the old kids’ cartoon with cavemen who turned dinos into cars and submarines!</p>

      <p>Our next Community Creature Vote winner will land on the corrupted earth, Extinction. Prepare your submissions for what we expect will bring out the endless creativity of our amazing community and you may find your creature making its debut with the release of the Extinction map on ARK: Survival Ascended!</p>
      <br>
      <p>Please note that this creature will be released for Extinction, so make sure your real-world submissions are in theme with that map! As previously stated, we’ll add an additional real-world creature for each expansion pack map release on ARK: Survival Ascended.</p>
